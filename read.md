# Study Helper For Turkish Students 

## Introduction
Turkish students studying in English speaking departments at the university are required
to edit and process the English sources while translating them into Turkish during their
studies. The aim is to make a program that is easy, practical and time-saving.

## Problem as an example

## My Tool
The tool simply translates the selected text into Turkish in the background and makes it pasteable directly. In the future, it is planned to add things such as different language selections or adding special characters.
